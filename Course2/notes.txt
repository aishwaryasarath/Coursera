### - In python prompt after doing pip3 install arrow
```python
import arrow
date = arrow.get('2020-01-18', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
date.shift(weeks=+6).format('MMM DD YYYY')
```
Inserting a shebang line (such as #!/usr/bin/env python3) as the first line tells the operating system what command we want to use to execute the script.
