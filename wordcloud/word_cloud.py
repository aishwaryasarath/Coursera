# Before processing any text, you need to remove all the punctuation marks.
# To do this, you can go through each line of text, character-by-character,
# using the isalpha() method. This will check whether or not the character
# is a letter.
# To split a line of text into words, you can use the split() method.
# Before storing words in the frequency dictionary, check if theyâ€™re part of
# the "uninteresting" set of words (for example: "a", "the", "to", "if").
# Make this set a parameter to your function so that you can change it if
# necessary.


#Input file
# For the input file, you need to provide a file that contains text only.
# For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website you like.
# Or you can use a site like Project Gutenberg to find books that are available
# online. You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books,
# like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen.
